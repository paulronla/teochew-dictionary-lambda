# Teochew-Dictionary-Backend on AWS Lambda
This is a port of [Teochew-Dictionary-Backend](https://github.com/paulronla/Teochew-Dictionary-Backend) 
to run on AWS Lambda and written in TypeScript. The intent is to allow 
[Teochew Pop-up Dictionary](https://github.com/paulronla/Teochew-Pop-up-Dictionary) 
to make 50% more "always free" tier requests (from 2 million to 3 million per month).
